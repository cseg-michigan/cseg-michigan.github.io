CSEG hosts social events from CSE graduate students. Recently, we've gone ice
skating at Yost, floating down the Huron, and biking over to Ypsilanti. We also
run weekly board game nights. Take a look at our calendar!

CSEG also hosts Tea time for casual conversations between students and faculty. Tea times happen weekly, usually at 4:00pm on Wednesday. Tea time is a weekly
social hour, hosted by a different students or research groups each week, and features
snacks and drinks. It's the favorite CSE way to socialize and get to know people!
