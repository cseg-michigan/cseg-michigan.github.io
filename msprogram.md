CSEG hosts a range of events for both Masters' and PhD program students.
CSEG has hosted faculty position hiring discussion and career discussions to support job seeking in both academia and industry after graduation.
This year we are also excited to introduce a range of initiatives for our Master's program members designed to enrich your experience both professionally and socially:
IBM Career Event: Kickstart your year with our exclusive event in January, with a talk by IBM about potential job opportunities and career guidance.
International Cultural Day: Celebrate the rich diversity of our community with a day dedicated to the various cultures represented in our program. Enjoy some food and meet people around the globe.
Social Gatherings: Unwind and connect with peers at our regular social events. From board games to ice skating, there's an activity for everyone to enjoy.
Stay tuned for these and other exciting opportunities to engage with fellow students, faculty, and industry professionals!
