CSEG represents graduate students at faculty meeetings, in admissions, and for faculty recruitment. In addition, the CSEG has been collaborating with the department on Explore Grad Studies in CSE Workshop, welcome week, and more.

Madelyn Gatchel is the Recruitment Chair & Admission Committee Student Representative. This past semester she served as admissions committee representative, and contributed in (1) providing input from student perspective at weekly meetings; (2) reviewing several AI applications; and (3) working with GPO/CSEG/ECSEL leaders to plan and lead the in-person visitation week. 

In addition to the listed responsibilities, between these two roles she would like to (1) formalize and coordinate a grad student volunteer committee to assist faculty with reviewing applications (particularly in AI); (2) compile and publish resources for crafting a compelling application; and (3) work with the committee/GPO to make the virtual visitation more accessible for international students/domestic students who are unable to travel. 

Shes passionate about increasing diversity within the department in regard to identity, background, and research interests.

Richard Higgins is the Faculty Recruitment Committee Student Representative, connecting graduate students with faculty and staff to help in the hiring of new faculty in the department. 

Reach out to him to relay clear and actionable perspectives on candidates and values. His goal is to collect concise points that can be easily weighed in faculty recruitment discussions.  

At a large school like the University of Michigan, selecting exceptional faculty at Michigan is especially important because new faculty enter a large organization where knowing everyone is difficult and peer relations should be carefully fostered. 

Further, Computer Science as a discipline has many subfields. Diverse subfields mean new professors may end up with a limited pool of peers who understand their research well. These potential concerns, coupled with the massive CS undergrad body, means every new faculty member needs to be exceptional. We want to select faculty who can be role models for the department from day one.
