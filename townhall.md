Graduate Student Town Hall
==========

The graduate student town hall will be happening virtually on **March 30th at 6pm**. CSE Division Chair Peter Chen, Associate Dean Michael Wellman, Professor Westley Weimer, and Associate Professor Emily Mower Provost will be in attendance.

This town hall will focus on climate and DEI issues relevant to graduate students, and all are welcome to attend virtually. Come to hear a statement of values from the new chair, info about ongoing investigations, climate survey results, and about ongoing DEI activities. Faculty members will also be taking questions. 

There are two ways to ask questions: 

1. You can submit any questions anonymously [here](https://pigeonhole.at/CSEGRADSTUDENTS2020). Dedicated question-askers will then ask these questions for you. 
2. You can "raise your hand", and ask your question when called-upon. To raise your hand, click on "Participants" on the bottom of your screen, and choose the hand-raise button. When called upon, you will be unmuted and you can then ask your question. 

The town hall will occur via Zoom. For information on how to sign into your University of Michigan Zoom account, [please follow the instructions here](https://its.umich.edu/communication/videoconferencing/zoom).
